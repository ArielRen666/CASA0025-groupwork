# CASA00025 Group Project - AquaTrend Mapper

## Project Summary 

Fill in the sections below to provide a brief summary of your project. Each section should have no more than 100 words. Do not edit any of the headings.

### Problem Statement 

What is the problem youâ€™re trying to address using this application? 

### End User 

Who are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?

(1) Policy makers. The application provides policy makers with a real-time water body change monitoring tool for Poyang Lake, which helps policy makers to develop and optimize water management measures.
(2) Researchers. The application supports their research in the field of water resources management and environmental change by providing tools for water body extraction and time series analysis in Poyang Lake.
(3) Public. The application provides a transparent and intuitive platform for the public to understand the real-time situation and change trends of Poyang Lake through visualization of data and charts, and to raise the public's attention to environmental issues.


### Data

What data are you using? 

Time: December 1, 2018 to November 31, 2021
Location: Poyang Lake Area
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery: Multiview processed Sentinel IW GRD class imagery. 
The radar image is imaged in IW mode with VV polarization.
Reasons:
1. Sentienl-1's SAR data are not constrained by weather, cloud cover, etc.
2. SAR data has been identified for frequent monitoring of surface water
3. SAR specular reflectivity separates open water from land surface
Data division: Spring: March-May; Summer: June-August; Autumn: September-November; Winter: December-February (next year).
Because, Poyang Lake wet season: June-August, normal water season: April, May and September, dry season: October-February of the next year (Yao, et al., 2021).

## How it Works 

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

```js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

You can include images:

and math:
$$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
