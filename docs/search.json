Do not edit any of the headings.\n\n\nWhat is the problem you’re trying to address using this application?\n\n\n\nWho are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?\n\nPolicy makers. The application provides policy makers with a real-time water body change monitoring tool for Poyang Lake, which helps policy makers to develop and optimize water management measures.\nResearchers. The application supports their research in the field of water resources management and environmental change by providing tools for water body extraction and time series analysis in Poyang Lake.\nPublic. The application provides a transparent and intuitive platform for the public to understand the real-time situation and change trends of Poyang Lake through visualization of data and charts, and to raise the public’s attention to environmental issues.\n\n\n\n\nWhat data are you using?\nTime: December 1, 2015 to November 30, 2021 Location: Poyang Lake, China Sentinel-1 satellite imagery: Multiview processed Sentinel IW GRD class imagery. The radar image is imaged in IW mode with VV polarization.\nReasons: 1. Sentienl-1’s SAR data are not constrained by weather, cloud cover, etc. 2. SAR data has been identified for frequent monitoring of surface water 3. SAR specular reflectivity separates open water from land surface\nData division: Spring: March-May; Summer: June-August; Autumn: September-November; Winter: December-February (next year). Because, Poyang Lake wet season: June-August, normal water season: April, May and September, dry season: October-February of the next year (Yao, et al., 2021).\n\n\n\nHow are you using this data to address the problem?\n\nScreening, cropping, smoothing preprocessing of Sentinel-1 radar image.\nOptimal thresholds were obtained using histograms generated from VV polarization data and calling otsu functions.\nMark pixels smaller than the threshold as bodies of water. Make non-water bodies be considered transparent.\nCalculate sum of the number of times a water body is present at each pixel point.\nTotal number of occurrences of water bodies / Total number of images = Frequency of occurrence of water bodies per pixel point. The frequency is filtered to be higher than a set threshold, thus showing areas of frequent water bodies.\n\n\n\n\nHow does your application’s interface work to address the needs of your end user?\n\n\n\n\nReplace the link below with the link to your application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):\nMap.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);\n\nMap.setOptions(\"satellite\");\n\nvar aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);\nYou can include images:\n\n\n\nPixelwise T-Test, 2018\n\n\nand math: \\[ \\Large t = {\\frac{\\overline{x_1}-\\overline{x_2}} {\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} \\]"
